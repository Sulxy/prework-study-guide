# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This guide was created to use as a foundation for understanding the basics of coding, and to get my personal computer ready for class. Also, to familiarize myself with and to begin creating healthy habits within all these different programs. 

The project was built to serve as a framework for future additions of my own making as I begin to learn more about coding, coding languages, and other programs.

This guide solves the problem of myself being unfamiliar with any coding languages, programs, or Git Flow. It's purpose it to teach me the basics of all the things necessary to succeed in this Coding Bootcamp. 

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to complete the Git Flow, how to practice Version Control, and familarized myself with terminology, and concepts that I was not aware of. I refamiliarized myself with changing directories, and using the command line -- things I already knew how to do, but had not used in years.

## Usage

This study guide can be used for my personal notes as I progress through this BootCamp course. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, but is not all inclusive. It contains lists of things that I have decided to document, and will grow longer with time. Chrome DevTools which can opened by pressing Command+Options+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There should be a console panel that opens up below, or to the side of the webpage. In that console you will see a list of topics that were learned about from the prework, and a suggestion on what to study first.
